### Curse of Dimensionality ###

When dealing with high dimensional data, common statistical tools often become ineffective. This thesis examines causes of these issues through an exploration of high dimensional spaces. We present some counterintuitive mathematical and statistical results from a geometric view. These results are exploited to modify an existing classification method and also introduce a new test statistic for the general distribution free two-sample problem. Other applications are briefly considered.
